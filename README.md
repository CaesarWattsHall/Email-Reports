# Email-Reports

# This project aims to automate the process of sending daily email reports using Python. The script leverages the smtplib library for sending emails and the schedule library to handle daily scheduling. This automation is particularly useful for sending regular updates, summaries, or any routine reports that need to be delivered consistently at a specified time each day.

# Key Features!
# 1) Email Composition:

The script composes an email with a specified subject and body.
The subject includes the current date to distinguish daily reports.
The email body can be customized to include any information or data that needs to be reported.

# 2) SMTP Integration:

Connects to an SMTP server to send emails.
Utilizes secure connections via TLS to ensure the email is sent securely.

# 3) Scheduling:

Uses the schedule library to set a specific time each day for sending the email.
Ensures that the email is sent at the same time every day without manual intervention.

# 4) Continuous Operation:

Runs indefinitely, checking the schedule and sending emails daily.
Can be terminated manually when needed.


# How It Works
# SMTP Configuration:

The script sets up the SMTP server details, including server address, port, sender's email, and password.

# Email Preparation:

A multipart email message is created with the necessary headers (From, To, Subject) and body content.

# Sending the Email:

Connects to the SMTP server using the provided credentials.
Sends the email to the specified recipient.

# Scheduling:

Uses the schedule library to define a specific time each day when the send_email function should run.
An infinite loop continuously checks for pending scheduled tasks and executes them.


# Setup Instructions
# Install Python:
Ensure Python is installed on your system.

# Install Required Libraries:
Install the schedule library using pip: (pip install schedule)


# Configure the Script:

Replace the SMTP server details, sender's email, and password.
Set the recipient's email address.
Customize the email subject and body as needed.

# Run the Script:
Save the script as email_report.py and run it using Python: (python email_report.py)

Continuous Operation:
Keep the script running to ensure the email report is sent daily. You can stop the script with Ctrl + C.

# Benefits!
# Automation: Removes the need for manual intervention in sending daily reports.
# Consistency: Ensures reports are sent at the same time every day.
# Efficiency: Saves time and reduces the likelihood of errors in the reporting process.

This project provides a reliable and straightforward solution for automating daily email reports, making it ideal for business operations, project updates, and other routine communications.
